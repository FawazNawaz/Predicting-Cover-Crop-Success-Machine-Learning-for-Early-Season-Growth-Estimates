Predicting Cover Crop Success: Machine Learning for Early-Season Growth Estimates
This project explores how machine learning can predict the future growth of cover crops early in the season. This information is valuable for farmers who can then schedule field operations more effectively, such as terminating the cover crop or planting the next cash crop.
